#Polyfood

#####Project Description:
Polyfood allows users to quickly identify the category, price range, quality and popularity of the restaurants within a custom defined polygon region on the map. Users can draw/edit/move multiple polygons directly on a map, the app then displays restaurants within each polygon area and filter out restaurants based on type of food, restaurant's rating, and many other filters. It also allows the user to compare the results by interacting with D3 built animated graphs.
