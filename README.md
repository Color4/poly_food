#Polyfood

#####Project Description:
Polyfood allows users to quickly identify the category, price range, quality and popularity of the restaurants within a custom defined polygon region on the map. Users can draw/edit/move multiple polygons directly on a map, the app then displays restaurants within each polygon area and filter out restaurants based on type of food, restaurant's rating, and many other filters. It also allows the user to compare the results by interacting with D3 built animated graphs.

I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Lehigh University where I double majored in Finance and Information System. After graduating, I worked as a Product Manager. In this role, I identified and implemented critical improvements to the companyâ€™s operations and built prototype web applications that improve operational inefficiencies across the team. I thought it was cool to help a lot of people saving a lot of manual work by coding, so I decided to transition to be a engineer.
